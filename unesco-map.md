The UNESCO World Heritage Tribute Map is an interactive web map launched in October 2023 as a tribute to UNESCO’s preservation and conservation work. The web map allows visitors to search, discover and explore the many cultural and natural UNESCO world heritage sites and their locations.

## Why create a map tribute to the UNESCO World Heritage List?
The purpose of the web map is educational, to help promote awareness and understanding of the UNESCO world heritage sites and the important work of UNESCO. It is intended to allow visitors an interesting geographic way to discover and learn about the heritage sites with information from UNESCO and explore the geography around the sites.

Today, more than ever, conservation work is crucial for the overall safety of our world. As UNESCO has pointed out, safeguarding heritage is critical as it brings countries and communities together, uniting people around a common belief in the value of our history and environment. In the next section you can learn more about UNESCO and why this preservation work is so important, with links to UNESCO site information.

The web map provides a search feature which allows users to search on site name, country and description field information. When the search returns selected sites, the user can click through the sites which displays an informational popup on the map with UNESCO information on the site, as well as a link to UNESCO’s dedicated page for the site. The popup also includes a link to the site location in Google Maps so the user can explore the location with satellite imagery and other features.

The [UNESCO World Heritage Tribute Map](https://greenlightgeo.github.io/ol-maps/maps/unesco_heritage/) was built using the OpenLayers map library, and uses UNESCO’s world heritage sites open data and OpenStreetMap as its basemap foundation.
