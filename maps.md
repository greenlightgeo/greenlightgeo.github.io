# Open Source Web Maps 

### Interactive Web Maps Built with Open Source Data, Tools and Platforms
Search and explore interesting locations around the world with open data and mapping tools.

*Special thanks* to all the data providers for sharing their data and imagery, and to OpenStreetMap for sharing their important open basemap, and
to OpenLayers for their open map library on which these maps were built.

*Please note:* These web maps have been designed for use on large screen devices such as laptops and larger tablets. They are not intended for use on mobile phones but may potentially be used on larger screen phones in landscape mode.
